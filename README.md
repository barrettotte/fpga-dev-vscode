# fpga-dev-vscode

Simple FPGA development workflow with VS Code.

The goal of this workflow is to avoid opening Vivado GUI.
The example in this repo is a simple 1Hz LED blink using Basys 3 Artix-7 board (XC7A35TCPG236-1).

## Development

This assumes Windows with WSL is used for FPGA development.

### Requirements

- Vivado 2023.2+
- GNU Make
- GTKWave

Verify Vivado is installed and its binaries (`xilinx/Vivado/2023.2/bin`) are in system path with `vivado -version`.
Also, verify GNU Make is installed with `make -v` and GTKWave is installed with `wsl -e gtkwave --version`.

### Workflow

Edit source in VS Code, the [vscode-verilog-hdl-support](https://github.com/mshr-h/vscode-verilog-hdl-support) extension seems to work well for Verilog and Tcl.

```sh
# build bitstream file
make build

# simulate, generate waveform, and open in gtkwave
make simulate

# build and upload bitstream to FPGA
make program_board
```

Optionally, you can still develop in project mode with the following:

```sh
# create Vivado project
make create_project

# open Vivado project in GUI
make gui
```
