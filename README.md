# fpga-dev-vscode

FPGA development workflow with VS Code.

The example in this repo is a simple LED blink using Basys 3 Artix-7 board.

## Development

TODO:

## Vivado in Docker

I decided to stick with a local installation of Vivado. But, I found a
very cool post about running Vivado in Docker - https://myon.info/blog/2024/07/06/vivado-docker/

My attempt based on this post can be found in [vivado-docker/](vivado-docker/).

I may try this again in the future and update this repo with more notes/instructions.
